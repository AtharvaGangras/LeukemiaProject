    <h2>About Leukemia</h2>
    <p>Leukemia is a type of cancer that affects the blood and bone marrow, characterized by the overproduction of abnormal white blood cells. These cells can interfere with the body's ability to produce healthy blood cells, leading to a range of health issues.</p>
    
    <h3>Types of Leukemia</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL):</strong> A fast-growing leukemia that affects lymphoid cells, most common in children.</li>
        <li><strong>Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML):</strong> A fast-growing leukemia that affects myeloid cells, common in adults.</li>
        <li><strong>Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL):</strong> A slow-growing leukemia that affects lymphoid cells, typically seen in older adults.</li>
        <li><strong>Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML):</strong> A slow-growing leukemia that affects myeloid cells, associated with a genetic mutation.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Symptoms</h3>
    <p>Common symptoms of leukemia include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Fatigue and weakness</li>
        <li>Frequent infections</li>
        <li>Easy bruising or bleeding</li>
        <li>Weight loss</li>
        <li>Swollen lymph nodes</li>
        <li>Fever or chills</li>
        <li>Persistent headaches</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Causes</h3>
    <p>The exact cause of leukemia is unknown, but several factors may increase the risk, including:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Genetic predisposition</li>
        <li>Exposure to radiation or chemicals</li>
        <li>Certain genetic disorders (e.g., Down syndrome)</li>
        <li>Smoking</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Diagnosis</h3>
    <p>Leukemia is diagnosed through a combination of tests, including:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Blood tests to check for abnormal blood cell counts</li>
        <li>Bone marrow biopsy to analyze the bone marrow cells</li>
        <li>Cytogenetic analysis to detect genetic changes in cells</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Treatment</h3>
    <p>Treatment options for leukemia may include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Chemotherapy to kill cancer cells</li>
        <li>Radiation therapy to target specific areas</li>
        <li>Stem cell transplant to replace damaged bone marrow</li>
        <li>Targeted therapy to focus on specific genetic mutations</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Prognosis</h3>
    <p>The prognosis for leukemia varies based on factors such as age, type of leukemia, and overall health. Early diagnosis and advances in treatment have improved survival rates significantly.</p>

    <p>If you or someone you know is experiencing symptoms of leukemia, it is essential to seek medical advice for proper diagnosis and treatment.</p>
